For example, to send an email, a user can use a program such as Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird, generically designed a *mail user agent* (MUA), to compose his message and send it. To send the message, the MUA typically connects to a *mail transfer agent* (MTA) that receives the message, analyzes the message's headers to determine the recipients and, after querying the DNS system to determine the MTA responsible for each recipient, it connects to the MTAs responsible for the destination addresses to deliver the message. Each of these MTAs receives the message and stores it locally or forwards it to others MTAs (for example, when there are forwards or aliases configured, or when the MTA that receives the message is not the ultimately responsible for the email address of the recipient). Given this simplified description of the operation of the email system, which of the following architectural styles is more appropriate to represent the pattern of interaction between the MTAs?",

A MapReduce job usually splits the input data-set into independent chunks which are processed by the map tasks in a completely parallel manner. The framework sorts the outputs of the maps, which are then input to the reduce tasks. Typically both the input and the output of the job are stored in a file-system. The framework takes care of scheduling tasks, monitoring them and re-executes the failed tasks.\"  \n  \nWhich architectural style of the component-and-connector viewtype is more adequate to describe how the MapReduce works, taking into account its main advantages in solving a problem?",

The GAE is described in the Wikipedia as follows:  \n>\"Google App Engine is a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers. Google App Engine is cloud computing technology. It virtualizes applications across multiple servers and data centers. [...] Google App Engine is free up to a certain level of used resources. Fees are charged for additional storage, bandwidth, or CPU cycles required by the application.\"  \n  \nOn the other hand, the GAE documentation reads the following:  \n>\"With App Engine, you can build web applications using standard Java technologies and run them on Google's scalable infrastructure. The Java environment provides a Java 6 JVM, a Java Servlets interface, and support for standard interfaces to the App Engine scalable datastore and services, such as JDO, JPA, JavaMail, and JCache. Standards support makes developing your application easy and familiar, and also makes porting your application to and from your own servlet environment straightforward.\"  \n  \nTaking into account these two perspectives on the GAE, which architectural styles are more appropriate to represent the use of GAE in the software architecture of your web application?",

Most chess engines do not have their own graphical user interface (GUI) but are rather console applications that communicate with a GUI such as XBoard (Linux) and WinBoard (Windows) via a standard protocol.\"  \n  \nIn the web page for XBoard, we may read the following:  \n>\"XBoard is a graphical user interface for chess [...]. It displays a chessboard on the screen, accepts moves made with the mouse, and loads and saves games in Portable Game Notation (PGN). It serves as a front-end for many different chess services, including:  \n-  Chess engines that will run on your machine and play a game against you or help you analyze, such as GNU Chess, Crafty, or many others.  \n-  [...]  \n\"  \n  \nGiven the above information on XBoard, chess engines, and how they interact at runtime, which of the following architectural styles best represents the of architecture of a software system based on XBoard and one of the engines?",
